prompt for search bar (not sure why the AI automatically started implementing)
Generate me a prompt to give to an LLM that will add a usable search bar to search and look up items, please analyse the entire codebase to make it responsive . and so that when the names of items in the website change. (or if i add more items to this shop) the search bar will still show those items.
