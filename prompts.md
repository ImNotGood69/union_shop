prompt for search bar (not sure why the AI automatically started implementing)

Generate me a prompt to give to an LLM that will add a usable search bar to search and look up items, please analyse the entire codebase to make it responsive . and so that when the names of items in the website change. (or if i add more items to this shop) the search bar will still show those items.

prompt for footer

please give me a footer that displays opening hours (make these just monday to friday 9am to 5pm) and a contact us page that uses the email: fakeemail@email.com
and a phone number that is :
076942099019

prompt for collections and carousel 

in the area where the large image with the button is. please turn it into a carousel, please add the button on the next slide that says "view collections", subsequently, create a page that would show collections of certain themes. these themes being autumn favourites, black friday. these clickable widgets should also include image tags. which i will populate later

prompt for arrows on carousel:

please add arrow shaped buttons to the left and right of the carousel so that you can click and go to the other part of the carousel

product page prompt to start off design,

in my app, i want to have widgets that would mimic a real store, please implement the image of the product. (currently whatever the product is, this will be changed later). i need to the left of the images a way to select different sizes (s, m, l, xl,) and a quanitity list, aswell as a rectangular purchase button, which doesnt have to work. please maintin the theme of the current website. ensuring that the look is modern.
